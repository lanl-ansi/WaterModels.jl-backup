It is designed to enable computational evaluation of historical and emerging water network formulations and algorithms using a common platform. The code is engineered to decouple Problem Specifications (e.g., water flow, optimal water flow, network expansion) from Network Formulations (e.g., mixed-integer linear, mixed-integer nonlinear). This decoupling enables the definition of a wide variety of water network optimization formulations and their comparison on common problem specifications.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#Installation-1","page":"Home","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The latest stable release of WaterModels can be installed using the Julia package manager with","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"] add WaterModels","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"For the current development version, install the package using","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"] add WaterModels#master","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Test that the package works by executing","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"] test WaterModels","category":"page"},{"location":"quickguide.html#Quick-Start-Guide-1","page":"Getting Started","title":"Quick Start Guide","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"quickguide.html#","page":"Getting Started","title":"Getting Started","text":"The following guide walks through the solution of a water network design problem using two mixed-integer linear programming formulations (MILP and MILP-R) of the network expansion (ne) problem specification.

To model the disjunction, each flow variable q_ij can be decomposed into two nonnegative flow variables, q_ij^+ and q_ij^-, where q_ij = q_ij^+ - q_ij^-. With this in mind, the following convex nonlinear program (CNLP) can be formulated, which is adapted from Section 3 of Global Optimization of Nonlinear Network Design by Raghunathan (2013):","category":"page"},{"location":"math-model.html#","page":"Mathematical Models","title":"Mathematical Models","text":"beginalign\n     textminimize\n      sum_(i j) in mathcalA fracL_ij r_ij2 + alpha left(q_ij^+)^2 + alpha + (q_ij^-)^2 + alpharight - sum_i in mathcalS h_i^textrmsrc left(sum_(i j) in mathcalA^-(i) (q_ij^+ - q_ij^-) - sum_(j i) in mathcalA^+(i) (q_ji^+ - q_ji^-)right) \n     textsubject to\n      sum_(j i) in mathcalA^-(i) (q_ji^+ - q_ji^-) - sum_(i j) in mathcalA^+(i) (q_ij^+ - q_ij^-) = q_i^textrmdem  forall i in mathcalJ labeleqncnlp-flow-conservation \n       q_ij^+ q_ij^- geq 0  forall (i j) in mathcalA labeleqncnlp-flow-bounds\nendalign","category":"page"},{"location":"math-model.html#","page":"Mathematical Models","title":"Mathematical Models","text":"renewcommandhat1widehat1","category":"page"},{"location":"math-model.html#","page":"Mathematical Models","title":"Mathematical Models","text":"Suppose that hatmathbfq^+ hatmathbfq^- in mathbbR^lvert A rvert solves (CNLP) with the associated dual solution hatmathbfh in mathbbR^lvert mathcalJ rvert, corresponding to the flow conservation Constraints eqrefeqncnlp-flow-conservation, and hatmathbfu^+ hatmathbfu^- in mathbbR^lvert mathcalA rvert, corresponding to the nonnegativity Constraints eqrefeqncnlp-flow-bounds.

More specifically, given a network consisting of reservoirs, junctions, and pipes, the problem aims to select the most cost-effecient resistance from a discrete set of resistances for each pipe to meet demand over the entire network. The set of all possible resistances for a given pipe (i j) in mathcalA is denoted as mathcalR_ij, where each resistance is denoted as r in mathcalR_ij. A binary variable x^r_ijr is associated with each of these diameters to model the decision, i.e., x_ijr^r = 1 if r is selected to serve as the pipe resistance, and x_ijr^r = 0 otherwise. The cost per unit length of installing a pipe of resistance r is denoted as c_ijr.","category":"page"},{"location":"formulations.html#Network-Formulations-1","page":"Network Formulations","title":"Network Formulations","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"specifications.html#Problem-Specifications-1","page":"Problem Specifications","title":"Problem Specifications","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"model.html#Water-Model-1","page":"WaterModel","title":"Water Model","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"objective.html#Objective-1","page":"Objective","title":"Objective","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"variables.html#Variables-1","page":"Variables","title":"Variables","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"variables.html#","page":"Variables","title":"Variables","text":"The following methods provide a compositional approach for defining common variables used in water network optimization models.
